<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains the code and information for the Bagel Bar Mobile app. This project allows the user to create an account, sign in, and update their information. The user can select an item from the menu, customize it, then add it to their shopping cart. Once an order is placed, the customer can view the active order at the home screen, along with items that have been favorited and previous orders.<br>
The React Native code connects to a PHP back-end where the database is then accessed. This database is stored on the web and is accessible with any internet connection.
